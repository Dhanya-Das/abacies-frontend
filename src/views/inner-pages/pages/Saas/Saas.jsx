                                <p>Disruption is the new reality of enterprises with ever-changing customer expectations and innovative business models. To thrive on disruption, enterprises must build value chains not only to achieve today’s goals but also to develop a revolutionary edge for the future.</p>
                                <p>Traditional IT models do not offer the flexibility and configurability required to create that operational edge while solving the current problems across the business—whether it is to improve customer experience, lower operational costs, or drive higher efficiency. </p>
                                <p>Moving to software-as-a-service (SaaS) models can be a game-changer for enterprises. SaaS is a cloud-based software delivery model in which software is centrally hosted on the Cloud, which is owned, managed, and maintained by cloud service providers. Shifting to an “as-a-service” model for their digital products and services allows enterprises to reduce the time to release new products, save on expensive IT hardware installations, and scale quickly with various integrations and other SaaS solutions. HCLTech and its close-knit partnership with Salesforce, Workday, Oracle and Blue Yonder provides a wide spectrum of offerings to our customers ready to adopt SaaS models.</p>
